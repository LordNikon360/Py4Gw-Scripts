# Py4Gw-Scripts
Nikons Scripts

This python package is meant for use with the Py4GW library to support the creation of various functions for the Guildwars 1 game.

These scripts provide utilities for identifying, salvaging, cleaning inventory, automation and other fun things.

Cloning this library will also clone the PY4GW library.

Launch the Py4GW launcher or inject the Py4GW.dll with any python injector.

Once Guildwars is launched and PY4GW is injected, select the folder icon on the console window.

Select the script to load, and hit the Play button.

*Use at your own risk, these functions are certainly trackable by the game developers!
